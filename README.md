Description:

    This script takes an input jurisdiction master list (xls document) and
    uses it to create a subset of the national adjustment (.xyz) file.
    The script also adopts (renames) jurisdiction mark names where there 
    is a conflict between NADJ and jurisdiction mark names.
    The jurisdiction xls has a column with NADJ mark names and another
    column containing jurisdiction mark names to adopt.
